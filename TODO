Add logging.

Add additional error-checking.

Check to see which python version is running and adjust code accordingly (platform.version()).

Add check to find out which distro is being used, and export list of explicitly-installed programs 
from that distro's package manager, test on popular distros (arch, mint, ubuntu, gentoo, debian, 
centos).

Add command-line options (?), and options to enable/disble automatic copying/moving
of archive to remote(s)

Always set working directory to where the program resides (otherwise, if called from another dir,
it does not see the .conf file)..

Do not force root. Do error checking for permissions and skipping files
or logging errors.

Allow choosing between creating gzip/zip/bz2 etc archive types.
